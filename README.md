## Usage

As a developer, I want a README generator so that I can quickly create a professional README for a new project

## Installation

1. To install and use Readme Generator, the end user should clone this project to a location on their local machine.
2. Once the end user has cloned the repository, they should open the generator in their installed version of a text editor (Visual Studio).
3. After the repository has been opened, run "npm init" in the terminal of thetext editor, or in the open terminal as long as the file path is at the root of the project. This will initialize the creation of a .json package (be sure to follow the prompts).
4. The final step to installing the Readme Generator will be to run "npm install inquirer" in the terminal. This step will install the inquier package into the node_modules folder.

**To run the program, write 'node index.js' in the terminal. Be sure to validate that the terminal is pointed to the program root**
